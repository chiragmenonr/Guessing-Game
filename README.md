# Olympics Emblem (Python Turtle)

## Description

This Python program uses the built-in **`turtle`** graphics module to draw the **Olympic rings emblem**. The program animates the drawing process by creating five colored circles arranged in the classic Olympic layout. Each ring is drawn using loops and precise turtle movements.

## How It Works

1. A Turtle graphics window titled **"Olympics Emblem"** is created.
2. The turtle is hidden and set to maximum drawing speed.
3. The turtle moves into position to begin drawing.
4. The program draws the **top row of three circles**:

   * Blue
   * Black
   * Red
5. The turtle repositions itself downward.
6. The program draws the **bottom row of two circles**:

   * Orange
   * Green
7. Each circle is created using small forward movements and rotations to form a smooth loop.
